* Give ConsoleDriver/GUIDriver a list of languages; allow language to be chosen (by flag or menu)
* Base class for Drivers?
* Environment should bind idents to values; allow more kinds of values than just Cells
* Generalize output (make Result type "showable"? add "print" to ExecutionContext, which does "show"?)
* Split into more language levels
